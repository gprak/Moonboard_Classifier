# Moonboard_Classifier
(Loosely based on our final project for the Erdos Data Science Bootcamp (https://github.com/gprak/moonBoard-24).)

We build a classifier that predicts the grade/difficulty of Moonboard Problems.  

## The MoonBoard
The MoonBoard (https://moonclimbing.com/what-is-moonboard) is a standardized training wall for rock climbers. It has an associated app that
contains close to 100000 moonboard problems/routes along with information about these routes including:
* Assigned Grade - A measure of difficulty of the route,
* Number of repeats - How many climbers have succesfully climbed the route (self-reported),
* Rating - User assigned measure for quality of the route, and
* User Grade - User assigned grade for the route (May differ from Assigned Grade)
